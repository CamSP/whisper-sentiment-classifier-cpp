 We're gonna fly on this jet that costs half a million dollars per flight.
 And we're also gonna fly on this $25,000 private jet,
 a $10,000 first class seat, a blimp, and so much more.
 But before I show you what it's like to fly on some of the most luxurious planes on the planet,
 we're gonna fly on the cheapest plane in the world.
 It's really rickety.
 Here's the dollar.
 I'm very nervous.
 Nothing to be nervous about. I've done this half a dozen times.
 You've done this six times?
 Why does this sound like a lawn mower engine?
 Time for a ride on the world's cheapest plane ticket.
 Oh boy. Oh my. Oh my gosh.
 Oh no.
 You're going so fast.
 Oh damn it!
 That does not sound safe.
 Keep your seatbelt on.
 You just focus on keeping me alive, Doug.
 I'm trying.
 All right, he's in the air.
 All right, Dibs on the channel.
 I got what I need. You can land whenever.
 No!
 Doug, come on, Doug, please.
 That guy pays my bills. Be careful.
 And if you guys think this is crazy, wait until later in the video when we have the
 most expensive plane ticket on the planet.
 Wait a minute, you're making me feel bad.
 Oh my God, he's coming in hot.
 You're ready to land.
 We're on the ground. We survived.
 Our next plane is the $1,000 first class plane ticket.
 But here's the thing, boys. I bought all the first class seats.
 So sit wherever you want.
 Would you like some miracle mist lotion?
 Why?
 Because first class made me fine dine it up.
 Each of us had our own seat and TV.
 The ticket also comes with a decent meal, a free bag of toiletries and pajamas.
 Do we get to take all this home with us?
 And during longer flights, recline.
 We should recline into a bed.
 I feel like I'm in a coffin, which I like.
 Yeah, this is crazy.
 And best of all.
 My favorite part about this $1,000 plane, I don't need to speak to Nolan.
 I don't like this glass because it like separates me.
 I'm all alone back there.
 That is the exact reason why I like it.
 The only downside is that you don't get a lot of privacy.
 It's really awkward filming a video with all these people walking by.
 So let's see what a plane ticket that is 10 times more expensive feels like.
 And now the $10,000 plane ticket.
 Oh man, this is nice.
 I have unlimited leg room here.
 Look, let's start off by analyzing what we get.
 A tablet, a giant touchscreen TV, my own in-seat drink bar, snacks.
 This isn't feasible chocolate.
 I want a refund.
 We're getting connected to the Wi-Fi.
 We might have paid $10,000 for our seat, but we still have to pay $20 for Wi-Fi.
 It's not free.
 Now we're taking off, which is pretty crazy because I can literally watch it on my TV.
 Because it's a 16-hour flight, I get to take a s--
 Look at how nice this bathroom is.
 You have a sink, a toilet, and then a shower.
 That is crazy.
 Look at that.
 We are 30,000 feet in the air and I can take a shower.
 On top of that, me and the boys can order as much gourmet food as we want.
 And that's not all.
 We saved the best for last.
 Hey, how's it going?
 There's a private lounge in the back of the plane.
 Hey, Jimmy.
 Yeah?
 Ow.
 You're not dreaming.
 That was the $10,000 plane ticket.
 Point the camera up and down.
 And now we're at the $25,000 plane ticket that is up these stairs.
 That's right.
 There's floors.
 This is insane.
 This is crazy.
 We're going to be sitting above other people.
 Oh my gosh.
 Now this is your room.
 For $25,000, you get two massive rooms.
 Oh, this is crazy.
 I've never seen anything like this.
 Holy cow.
 Our space on this plane is literally four times bigger than the last one.
 I've never seen a plane where I can comfortably do jumping jacks.
 Look at this.
 We also get two chairs, a ton of TVs.
 There are more TVs in this one room than all of the other planes we've been on.
 Food served by a personal flight attendant.
 Why is it that after a certain price point, they always give you caviar?
 And a bathroom.
 Can we talk about something?
 This bathroom is like a disappointment.
 No shower, no heated floors.
 Half the size.
 I think the $10,000 flight was a better price point.
 Would you pay this kind of money for a single flight?
 I wouldn't recommend this.
 I would recommend a car.
 Buy a car instead.
 And now the best part of the room.
 A queen-size bed.
 Why don't they just make every seat a bed?
 Bro, instead of three seats side by side, just put a bunk bed with three beds.
 Good morning.
 That was really good sleep.
 Carl, wake up.
 We're gonna land.
 I slept like a rock.
 That was the most expensive commercial flight.
 Time for private flights.
 This is the $100,000 plane.
 This thing too.
 At this price point, you get the entire plane.
 Private, private, private.
 Oh, it's like a yacht.
 This is wild.
 This is unbelievable.
 You want to know the craziest part?
 This is just one of four rooms.
 There's more to the plane?
 I thought this was it.
 Guys, come over here.
 What room is this?
 This is literally another lounge area with a bunch of snacks and a huge TV.
 And if you're feeling tired, you get your own private bedroom.
 Dude, what?
 This is like a hotel.
 And last but not least, the bathroom.
 Tariq, shut your mouth right now.
 Shut it.
 This is insane.
 There's a sink in the bathroom, dude.
 Have you ever even seen a jet half this size?
 No.
 Never.
 What do we talk about while on our private jet?
 Well, I'll tell you.
 Last year I sold the Smitherman's account.
 Oh, wait.
 I just realized I'm taking off backwards.
 I'm going to take this off.
 Oh, no.
 Oh, no.
 Oh, no.
 No, bro.
 Oh, no.
 I didn't realize you were taking off.
 Stop the camera.
 Stop.
 This is crazy.
 Bro, it's blue.
 Oh, my god.
 I can just roll back.
 Oh, turn.
 All right, I'm going to sit down.
 This might be the best bathroom yet.
 This is the toilet.
 On the toilet, you can watch TV.
 Hey, Nolan, I hope you feel comfortable in the bathroom.
 What's going on?
 I'm so confused.
 No.
 No.
 He's never getting out.
 Oh, wow.
 I have steak, mashed potatoes, and veggies.
 And you guys inspired me a little bit.
 So I brought some people out.
 Yeah.
 This is my favorite plane because it has YouTube.
 But we didn't pop up first, so now it's not.
 You can tell this is a rich person, Ben,
 because there's like 500 pillows.
 This one out of here.
 That one out of here.
 Yeah.
 I'm going to fly this thingy.
 And that's the beauty of flying private.
 You can do whatever you want whenever.
 Carl's flying the plane.
 Chandler's jamming out the pizza.
 Chris is taking a nap.
 And I don't even know where Nolan went.
 There's no layovers when you fly private.
 And there's no TSA, so you save tons of time.
 Hence why basically every rich person you know
 owns a private jet.
 Hey, guys.
 Yeah?
 We're going to land soon.
 Carl!
 Let me out.
 We're about ready to land.
 You got to let me out, bro.
 Oh my god.
 That was the opposite of smooth.
 Wait, wait.
 Is Nolan still in the bathroom?
 I don't know.
 Is he?
 Carl, don't let him out.
 How was your flight?
 Still better than the $1,000 plane.
 And now the $300,000 blimp.
 I'll unblurred in a second.
 Before I remove your blindfolds, what do you think
 is on the side of the blimp?
 Is it Nolan's phone number?
 Did you do Nolan's phone number?
 That would be funny.
 Next time.
 Take off your blindfolds.
 Turn around.
 I hurt Carl's mom?
 Oh my god.
 Why?
 He really loves my mom.
 No, Carl.
 He hearts your mom.
 He doesn't love your mom.
 That'd be weird.
 No, I'd love her.
 Oh.
 Dude, am I pushing it right now?
 It's like moving.
 This giant aircraft can literally just be pulled by a rope.
 And you might be wondering, how did I afford this giant blimp
 and pay six figures to wrap it?
 Zip Recruiter, a recruiting platform that I use to hire
 people like editors, cameramen, and accountants.
 Let's see if it stops floating when I get on it.
 That's gains, dude.
 Does that mean I'm fat?
 It means you work out a lot.
 Or I'm fat.
 Zip Recruiter is where people go to discover
 their next great job.
 If this blimp crashes and I die, you guys could just
 use Zip Recruiter to find a new job.
 That'll make it so much easier.
 Thanks, man.
 I feel like I don't like this conversation.
 Shh.
 All right, let's do this.
 Goodbye, Chandler.
 Goodbye.
 Forever.
 I think I heard forever.
 He could have promoted anything when he chose Carl's mom.
 I'm terrible.
 This thing's picking up speed.
 Well, we'll see you at the race.
 Oh, and I forgot to mention, we're flying this blimp
 over 150,000 people at the world's largest race car event.
 And Carl has no idea.
 Before I die in this blimp, I want to tell you guys
 about Zip Recruiter.
 We recently made a job posting on Zip Recruiter,
 and I'm going to call one of the candidates and interview them.
 Hey, Thomas, I saw your application on Zip Recruiter.
 Can you hear me?
 Yes, I can.
 Is this Mr. Meese?
 Yeah, I'm Mr. Meese.
 Doesn't matter.
 Sorry, I can barely hear you right now.
 Yeah, because we're on a blimp.
 How long have you been an editor for?
 I've been an editor for about 10 years.
 Do you think you can improve our videos?
 I think with a strong team and a little creative innovation,
 I can definitely make your videos better.
 OK, not bad.
 Give me some examples of your work.
 If, like Thomas, you want a shot to come work for us,
 click the link in the description or go to
 ZipRecruiter.com/MrMeese.
 We're going to look at every single person that applies.
 We are now over the day total 500, which is one of the busiest events ever.
 You couldn't have put something better on the blimp?
 No, this is perfect.
 This is wrong.
 Can they see us?
 Carl, I can confirm everyone loves your mom down here.
 I love Carl's mom!
 Everybody's like, "We love Carl's mom!"
 Carl's mom, if you're watching.
 You're a lovely lady.
 You're a psycho for your mom.
 And now, the most expensive private plane ticket on the planet.
 Hi, welcome aboard.
 I suggest you take your shoes off.
 The carpet's actually $2 million.
 Can't wait.
 She's like, "I suggest it. Really hard."
 And by square feet, this is bigger than our houses.
 It's almost impossible to imagine how big this jet actually is.
 Right here is a bedroom.
 Wow.
 A bedroom.
 Another bedroom.
 Another bedroom.
 Keep going.
 This is for the crew.
 Another bedroom.
 Another bedroom.
 What'd you find?
 My dibs.
 The bedrooms on this plane are way more extravagant.
 Gold-plated sinks, multiple showers.
 Wait, what's in there?
 That's the toilet.
 This plane comes with its own theater,
 a lounge that can seat up to 12 people,
 and then over here is the living room.
 This is like a bigger couch than what I have in my house.
 I just want you to note, you've only seen a third of the plane so far.
 There's more?
 What?
 Oh, got some good stuff.
 You can call a flight attendant to your bedroom.
 If we could do this every time we fly, I'd live in the air.
 Whoa, whoa, what is that?
 Sorry, I'm turning the lights on and off.
 How did I miss this room?
 Like, we walked around the whole plane.
 And in case you thought you saw everything,
 there's also massages on this plane.
 How is it, Carl?
 It's amazing.
 So I really just shouldn't.
 Gentlemen, how were we able to afford this plane?
 I would say only our fans.
 And because of that, we invited a bunch of random subscribers
 on this half a million dollar plane ride.
 Have you ever flown on a private jet before?
 No, this is my first time.
 And it's the most expensive one on the planet.
 I've never seen anything like this on a plane.
 Like, this is crazy.
 Ma'am, what is this right here?
 That's gas-based chocolate.
 Can you just throw it?
 OK.
 I think she's literally throwing it.
 This is the chocolate you need to serve from now on, OK?
 Got it.
 It's called Feast of Wolves.
 It's the highest rated chocolate on the planet.
 What the heck is over this way?
 Yo, this has got to be a secret room.
 That's where the crew is.
 We just got a bunch of funny looks.
 Attention, boys.
 We're about to take off.
 Passing your seatbelt and stop being a little giggly.
 Thank you.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Typically, what kind of people fly on a plane like this?
 Business people.
 How do my dumb friends compare?
 I'm pretty dumb.
 I guess it's--
 [LAUGHTER]
 At this price point, they serve the highest quality food
 anytime you want it and wherever on the plane you want it,
 even in your own private master suite.
 You want some?
 [LAUGHTER]
 You guys even know where we're going?
 No.
 We're taking you all to Disney World,
 and we're going to give you two days of all-expense paid trips
 to do whatever you want.
 [CHEERING]
 No way.
 So if you want to fly on the most expensive jet in the world
 and then spend two days all paid for in Disney World, subscribe.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 My life, my life, my life.
 I'ma love you for the rest of my life.
